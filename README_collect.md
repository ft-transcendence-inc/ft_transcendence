The `collectstatic` command in Django is used to collect all static files from your various apps and any other locations specified in `STATICFILES_DIRS` into a single location defined by the `STATIC_ROOT` setting. This is particularly useful for deployment to production, where you want a single directory with all static files that can be served by your web server (e.g., Nginx or Apache).

Here's a brief overview of what happens when you run `collectstatic`:

1. **Find Static Files**:
   Django looks in each app's `static` directory and any directories specified in the `STATICFILES_DIRS` setting for static files. This includes JavaScript, CSS, images, and other static assets.

2. **Copy Static Files**:
   It then copies all these files into the directory specified by the `STATIC_ROOT` setting. This centralizes all the static files into one location.

3. **Overwrite Confirmation**:
   If there are existing files in the `STATIC_ROOT` directory, Django asks for confirmation to overwrite them. This is to prevent accidental overwriting of files.

4. **Efficient Serving**:
   By collecting all static files into one directory, you can efficiently serve these files in a production environment using a web server optimized for serving static content.

### Example of `settings.py` with Static File Configuration

```python
import os
from pathlib import Path

BASE_DIR = Path(__file__).resolve().parent.parent

# URL to use when referring to static files
STATIC_URL = '/static/'

# Directories where Django will look for additional static files
STATICFILES_DIRS = [
    BASE_DIR / "static",
    BASE_DIR / "pong/static",
]

# The directory where collectstatic will put all the static files
STATIC_ROOT = BASE_DIR / "staticfiles"
```

### Steps You Performed

1. **Set up `STATIC_ROOT`**:
   You configured the `STATIC_ROOT` in `settings.py` to specify where collected static files should be stored.

2. **Run `collectstatic`**:
   You ran the `collectstatic` command:

   ```bash
   python manage.py collectstatic
   ```

3. **Overwrite Confirmation**:
   You were prompted to confirm overwriting existing files in the `STATIC_ROOT` directory, and you confirmed by typing `yes`.

4. **Files Collected**:
   Django collected all static files from the app-specific directories and the directories specified in `STATICFILES_DIRS` and copied them to the `STATIC_ROOT` directory.

By running `collectstatic`, you ensured that all your static assets are in one place, making it easier to serve them in a production environment. For development, using the built-in server or a tool like WhiteNoise helps serve these files correctly.
