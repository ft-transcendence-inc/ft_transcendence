# Django Project Structure

In a Django project, the structure is organized in a specific way to promote maintainability and scalability. Below is the typical structure of a Django project:

```
my_project/
├── manage.py
├── my_project/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── settings.py
│   ├── urls.py
│   ├── wsgi.py
│   ├── asgi.py
│   ├── ...
├── my_app/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── admin.py
│   ├── apps.py
│   ├── models.py
│   ├── tests.py
│   ├── views.py
│   ├── migrations/
│   │   ├── __init__.py
│   │   ├── ...
│   ├── templates/
│   │   ├── ...
│   ├── static/
│   │   ├── ...
│   ├── ...
├── ...
```

## Key Components

### `manage.py`
- Located in the root directory of the project.
- It's a command-line utility that lets you interact with this Django project. It does things like starting a development server, running tests, or creating new apps within the project.

### `my_project/` (project directory)
- Contains the main configuration files for the Django project.
- `__init__.py`: An empty file that tells Python this directory should be considered a Python package.
- `settings.py`: Configuration file for the Django project (database settings, installed apps, middleware, etc.).
- `urls.py`: URL declarations for the project; it maps URLs to views.
- `wsgi.py`: Entry point for WSGI-compatible web servers to serve the project.
- `asgi.py`: Entry point for ASGI-compatible web servers to serve the project.

### `my_app/` (application directory)
- Represents a specific application within the project. A project can contain multiple applications.
- `__init__.py`: An empty file that tells Python this directory should be considered a Python package.
- `admin.py`: Configuration for the Django admin interface.
- `apps.py`: Configuration for the application itself.
- `models.py`: Models for the application (defines the database schema).
- `tests.py`: Test cases for the application.
- `views.py`: Views for the application (contains the logic for handling requests and returning responses).
- `migrations/`: Contains database migrations for the application.
- `templates/`: Directory for HTML templates.
- `static/`: Directory for static files (CSS, JavaScript, images).

## Additional Files and Directories
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the project's dependencies.
- `README.md`: Contains information about the project.
- `.env`: Stores environment variables.

Each Django project will have one `manage.py` file, typically located in the root directory of the project. Each application within the project will have its own set of files like `models.py`, `views.py`, etc., organized in a similar structure.
